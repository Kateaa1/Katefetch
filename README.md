# Katefetch
A janky neofetch clone in python


It's called Katefetch because my name is Kate.

It is very janky, the only logo it supports is the small opensuse tumbleweed logo from fastfetch

along with that the GPU is hardcoded as the RX 7800 XT because that is the GPU in my computer, it is hardcoded because i could not figure out how to get the GPU name from python, is there a way? absolutely, am i going to do it? not right now.

I mostly  wrote this to mess around with Python and learn some basics.
